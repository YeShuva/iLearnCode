### HTML Tags


```javascript
var s = "JavaScript syntax highlighting";
alert(s);
```
 
```html
<h1>Top level heading: Maybe a page title</h1>

<p>A paragraph of text. Some information we would like to communicate to the viewer. This can be as long or short as we would like.</p>

<ol>
  <li>Number one on the list</li>
  <li>Number two</li>
  <li>A third item</li>
</ol>
```
 
```
No language indicated, so no syntax highlighting. 
But let's throw in a <b>tag</b>.
